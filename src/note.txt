- numbering of program blocks

- [type data in dousa] left side gets hidden

- delete confirmation (small popup [yes or no]  -> hotkey enter)

- confirm [output to CML] when there is a program block with no value

- wierd layout behaviour when added multiple rows, then delete rows

- design

data-input -> ok -> set data -> 変換 -> toCML
data-input -> setdata -> 変換 -> toCML
